				  <h4>about</h4>
				  <p>I am a Computer Science Concentrator at Harvard University in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I am pursuing my A.B. and S.M. in Computer Science from the same. I run the Harvard College's first club on quantitative finance and research, <a href="globalarc.org">ARC</a>. I also spend my time doing research and working on projects. </p>

                      <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street Capital</a>, a hedge fund in New York. While in school, I worked part-time for a few startups (like <a href="kensho.com">Kensho</a>) and have devoted some time to starting my own. You can read more about that in the projects section.</p>

                      <p>My research in school focused primarily on agent dynamics in multi-agent systems. However I have always had a great interest in biology and economics, and will soon have a paper published there as well. Please see my research for more details</p>

  				<h4>projects</h4>
  				<p>Trading is a science. And I would argue the purest form of science. Chemistry seeks to explain chemical reactions and emergent properties thereof, then stops there. Biology rests on giant’s shoulders and tries to not only to explain the chemistry of DNA, but its evolution. Psychology then leans on biology to explain phenomenology in its field. Each stands on the shoulders of the more basic sciences to explain something greater. Trading does that and more. It seeks to describe the world. In some instances, the psychology of the market, in others the biology of specific strain of wheat, and in others the chemistry of new antibiotics. Trading rests on the shoulders of giants, but seeks to do something that all science aspires to; trading seeks to explain the world. Below I have listed a site that I have poured a great deal of energy into. So to the fellow scientists out there, enjoy.</p>

                      <p>For those more interested in technology and startups, I am also working on another idea. The idea is called stances. It is currently in the works, so when you have a chance, please check out:

				  <h4>research</h4>
				  <p>This is by no means a comprehensive list of research, but will represent what I find most relevant to me. It is sorted in a timeline and is thus sorted in a rough ordering of quality, those coming last being better, and more wizened than previous works. If interested in any of the works feel free to contact me, and I will see what I can do to assist you, including providing code. On a final note, the research here will lack most of my research into trading, which is of course covered in the trading section of this site. </p>
